# Introduction
The adventurers find themselves in the village of Fuling. A beautiful, serene village located high in the Angzh mountains. Before the first session, the adventurers should be able to answer the following questions from the Player’s Handout:

You are a visitor in the village, what is your reasoning for visiting the village?

What all have your done throughout your visit to the village?

Did you meet any interesting characters throughout your visit?

You’re nearing the end of your visit, where does your character intend to travel next?

The ability to effectively answer these questions should influence how the characters are treated by certain NPC’s throughout the adventure.

## Overview
This micro-campaign is broken into three parts:

1. __Crime &amp; Punishment:__  the adventurers find themselves in a position where they are interrogated for the theft of the Platinum Ptarian Tablet from the Temple of Bahamut.

2. __Search &amp; Rescue:__  the adventurers discover that three innocent children have been abducted and should be presuaded to return them to safety. This poses a moral dilemma  if they refuse as the children will die from their capture.

3. __The Race for Time:__  eventually the adventurers learn that there is a time limit on the rescue of the children. The kidnappers plan to sacrifice the children for a ritual that must be performed on a specific day and time.

## Villains
The adventurers face three dragonwomen as their primary villains: __Yukisu__, __Runhika__ and __Misaru__. They are worshipers of the evil dragon goddess __Tiamat__ (_Akuma_) and are looking to seek favor with the goddess by joining the __Cult of the Dragon__.  Through their use of clerical rituals and their dragonspawn – the evil children of Tiamat – they form a team of powerful adversaries.

## Allies
The adventurers are able to gain allies throughout the adventure. Most notably, the dragonborn priest by the name of __Hiro__ (_Charisma DC 10_). The priest worships in the __Temple of Bahamut__ and is especially convinced of the adventurer’s innocence while being interrogated. There should be many opportunities for the adventurers to form this alliance. 

Other potential allies include __Virero__ (_Charisma DC 15_) and the __Scales of Ha__ (_Charisma DC 20_).

## Goal
The __primary goal__ for the adventurers will be to rescue the kidnapped children safely and prevent the rituals from being performed.

The __secondary goal__ is to return the stolen tablet safely to the temple. A stretch goal would be to capture the villains and bring them to justice.

## Adventure Hook
While visiting the village of Fuling, the players are __accused of stealing an item from the temple__. The interrogation is a distraction and gives the villains an opportunity to kidnap the dragonborn children.

As a result, the adventurers are forced to join the Scales of Ha to prove their loyalty to Bahamut. In doing so they should gain his favor and remove any doubt of their innocence.

## Climax
The adventurers should journey through the __Angzh Mountains__, through cavernous dungeons and eventually to the villain’s lair. There they should find the children trapped in a trio of rituals.

Ideally the adventurers should need to work together to save all three children at the same time. The potential should exist for one or more children to live yet the others perishing. This should put pressure on the outcome of the adventurers’ actions.
