# Introduction
The adventurers find themselves in the village of Fuling. A beautiful, serene village located high in the Angzh mountains. Before the first session, the adventurers should be able to answer the background questions from the Player’s Handout.

The ability to effectively answer these questions should influence how the characters are treated by certain NPC’s throughout the adventure.

## Overview
This micro-campaign is broken into three parts:

1. __Crime &amp; Punishment:__  the adventurers find themselves in a position where they are interrogated for the theft of the Platinum Ptarian Tablet from the Temple of Bahamut.

2. __Search &amp; Rescue:__  the adventurers discover that three innocent children have been abducted and should be presuaded to return them to safety. This poses a moral dilemma  if they refuse as the children will die from their capture.

3. __The Race for Time:__  eventually the adventurers learn that there is a time limit on the rescue of the children. The kidnappers plan to sacrifice the children for a ritual that must be performed on a specific day and time.

## Villains
The adventurers face three dragonwomen as their primary villains: __Yukisu__, __Runhika__ and __Misaru__. They are worshipers of the evil dragon goddess __Tiamat__ (_Akuma_) and are looking to seek favor with the goddess by joining the __Cult of the Dragon__.  Through their use of clerical rituals and their dragonspawn – the evil children of Tiamat – they form a team of powerful adversaries.

## Allies
The adventurers are able to gain allies throughout the adventure. Most notably, the dragonborn priest by the name of __Hiro__ (_Charisma DC 10_). The priest worships in the __Temple of Bahamut__ and is especially convinced of the adventurer’s innocence while being interrogated. There should be many opportunities for the adventurers to form this alliance. 

Other potential allies include __Virero__ (_Charisma DC 15_) and the __Scales of Ha__ (_Charisma DC 20_).

## Goal
The __primary goal__ for the adventurers will be to rescue the kidnapped children safely and prevent the rituals from being performed.

The __secondary goal__ is to return the stolen tablet safely to the temple. A stretch goal would be to capture the villains and bring them to justice.

```
```


## Adventure Hook
While visiting the village of Fuling, the players are __accused of stealing an item from the temple__. The interrogation is a distraction and gives the villains an opportunity to kidnap the dragonborn children.

As a result, the adventurers are forced to join the Scales of Ha to prove their loyalty to Bahamut. In doing so they should gain his favor and remove any doubt of their innocence.

## Climax
The adventurers should journey through the __Angzh Mountains__, through cavernous dungeons and eventually to the villain’s lair. There they should find the children trapped in a trio of rituals.

Ideally the adventurers should need to work together to save all three children at the same time. The potential should exist for one or more children to live yet the others perishing. This should put pressure on the outcome of the adventurers’ actions.

## Know Your Players
It is important to know the role each player will fill in the campaign.

- Acting (A):  getting into character and speaking in their characters’ voices.

# Part 1:  Crime &amp; Punishment
The adventure begins in the Village of Fuling where the players have been visiting. The background questions from the Player's Handout should have been researched and ready to be answered before beginning the first session:

- You are a visitor in the village, what is your reasoning for visiting the village?
- What all have your done throughout your visit to the village?
- Did you meet any interesting characters throughout your visit?
- You’re nearing the end of your visit, where does your character intend to travel next?

> ### Narration:
> 
> You find yourselves in the tavern of the Fujiya Lodge. The ornate wooden multi-story lodge is located a few minutes walk from the village centre. The tavern has a large semi-circular wooden bar that appears to rise from the floor itself and several sets of tables made of large tree trunks. At the bar you see the enormous bartender serving an elderly dragonman.

While in the tavern, the characters should introduce themselves to each other. If necessary provoke them with a friendly dragonborn such as __Virero__ or __Komoi__ by asking who each character is and how their travels have been. 

The party may hear from a few of the NPC’s mentioning a gentle smoke and rumble over the past couple of days. The characters are encouraged to order food and drink while in the tavern, see the menu.

After a while of dialogue or if there’s a lull in the conversation have the party all roll a D20. 

__A volcano has erupted.__ 

<div class='descriptive'>
##### Dexterity/Acrobatics DC 5:
<ul>
  <li style="color:#007E7E;font-weight:bold">SUCCESS - the adventurer is still standing;</li>
  <li style="color:#7E0000;font-weight:bold">FAIL - the adventurer falls to the ground and will take damage (1D4).</li>
<ul>
</div>


Choose either Komoi or Virero to begin speaking to the adventurers:

> *with a heavy sigh*, “...It appears that Ryū’s Doom has returned to Fuling."
>
> *After a brief pause, he continues,*
>
> "This has happened before... I believe roughly 160 years ago. Then, it almost consumed the entire village in its wrath.”

```
```

> ### Food Menu: 
> _rice and mountain spring water are included with all meals_
> 
> - Roasted Duck and Asparagus (2 sp)
> - Braised Pork and Green Onions (15 cp)
> - Dried Hare and Beetroot (15 cp)
> - Salmon and Turnips (10 cp)
> 
> ### Drink Menu:
>

> - Tankard of Local Beer (5 cp)

Below are a few of the NPCs in the tavern:

------
> ### Virero
> Virero is an elderly dragonman with grey hair set upon his ruby red scales. His eyes resemble the withering embers of a once great roaring fire nearing its end. His personality is warm and comforting and many people treat him like the grandfather they’ve always known, while learning as much as possible from his love of telling Nirimsese Folktales.
>
> Virero lives on a farm about 20 minutes  from the lodge on the edge of the village centre. He enjoys coming to the tavern to speak to the tourist and share his stories.

-------
> ### Komoi
> Komoi is an enormous dragonman with green scales. He has a large square face  with bushy eyebrows. He is the owner of Fujiya Lodge.

## Detainment
The players may take their time to question the NPC’s about what is happening. After about 15-30 minutes of game time:

> ### Narration:
> 
> A stern-looking dragonman walks into the tavern accompanied by two guards. The dragonman’s many red-green scales coat his tall thin body and his face features a long pointy chin. The guards are wearing bold red robes with platinum belts. A symbol of two leaves balanced on a branch is clearly visible.

The dragonman is __Hakik, Head Dragon of Fuling__. The guards are known to be the __Scales of Ha__. A dialogue has occurred between Kakik and Komoi. After a minute or two the guards face to the adventurers, upon doing so the players will roll a D20.

<div class='descriptive'>
##### Charisma/Deception DC 20:

Success required by at least two players, the adventurers are now allied with the Scales of Ha for the duration of the adventure. If fail the guards will accuse the adventurers of committing the theft.

<ul>
  <li style="color:#007E7E;font-weight:bold">SUCCESS - the guards approach the adventurers to enlist their help. After some time for dialogue, skip to Part 2: Search &amp; Rescuse.;</li>
  <li style="color:#7E0000;font-weight:bold">FAIL - the guards shout, “STOP! YOU MUST COME WITH US!”</li>
<ul>
</div>

### Alternate
It's possible for the adventurers to leave the tavern before getting arrested. In this scenario the villagers will be making their way to the temple for shelter. By leaving shelter the adventurers are at risk for getting damage from the ash in the air (especially not being dragonborn).

<div class='descriptive'>
##### Constitution DC 15:

If the adventurer has not covered their mouth with any damp cloth then they are succeptible to lung damage.

<ul>
  <li style="color:#007E7E;font-weight:bold">SUCCESS - no effect</li>
  <li style="color:#7E0000;font-weight:bold">FAIL - roll 1D4 for damage</li>
<ul>
</div>

As the adventurers make their way through the crowd to the temple they will be spotted by the guards unless they are in stealth.

If they remain undetected there is an opportunity to befriend __Hiro__.

```
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendnd/modules/master/doom-of-bahamut/assets/img/scales-of-ha.png" style="margin:20px" />

__The Scales of Ha__, or _Ha no Uroko (葉の鱗) in Nirimsese Draconic_, are a religious order and de facto police force for the Village of Fuling. Founded in 2985 N¥ by Hakik. They are relatively inexperienced as they are a new order and have had little to no challenges to season them.

Their symbol is composed of two leaves balanced upon a branch and wear bold red robes with a platinum belt. The Scales of Ha are led by Taryash, First Sensei of the order.

__Taryash__ is a medium-sized dragonman with green scales and ruby eyes. Often described as extremely clever and an extraordinary fighter. The long pointy ends of his mustache resemble the two swords he often uses in fighting.

The adventurers are being arrested, and will be interrogated by the Scales of Ha. They must account for their events over the past day. The interrogation takes place in the Palace of the Head Dragon (or alternatively can take place in the temple).


<div class='pageNumber'>3</div>
<div class='footnote'>DM'S GUIDE  | Part 1:  Crime &amp; Punishment</div>

\page

## Interrogation
The adventurers are detained by the __Scales of Ha__. There is a crisis going on as the Angzh mountains have just erupted hot ash and embers that shot across the sky. The mountains are to the east of the Village of Fuling. The farmers and poorest villagers have gathered outside the shut doors of the __Temple of Bahamut__. They fear their homes being destroyed and having no where to go.

While the eruption happened, there was a robbery at the temple. The sacred __Ptarian Code Tablet__ has been stolen.  The adventurers are either brought by the Scales of Ha to the center of the temple near the statues and the missing tablet or they are brought to the palace for interrogation.

> <span style="color:#79093C">Hakik speaks, "Taryash, deal with these sukeru. I am needed by the people of Fuling. I shall return to get to the bottom of this."</span>
>
> _Sukeru_ is local slang for "foreigner" and is considered derogative.

The players are left with __Taryash__, First Sensei of the Scales of Ha. They are also left with 5 other guards: __Kazuy, Yumakiro, Takeme, Hazuumo and Haka__. __Hiro__ the cleric who was in the temple at the time is also present along with the Head Priest __Hastun__. The adventurers are placed on their knees with their hands bound with red rope and a platinum clamp.

> ### Dialog
> Read descriptions of the characters Hatsun, Hiro and Taryash. Then proceed with the following dialog:
> 
> <span style="color:#1F687C">Hatsun: "How could this have happened? Hiro, you were in the temple! How could someone have taken the tablet!"</span>
>
> <span style="color:#097933">Hiro, goes to his knees: "Oh most honorable Hatsun, I am so very sorry please forgive me. I was overwhelmed with exhaustion and fell asleep. I only awoke from the sound of the eruption and saw that the tablet was missing."</span>
> 
> <span style="color:#1F687C">Hatsun: "What a disgrace! Who would steal from the temple!"</span>
>
> <span style="color:#792909">Taryash: "It is as our great Head Dragon Hakik has predicted! Ever since we have allowed the Sukeru to enter our village and temples, we have brought nothing but disgrace to our ancestors! All for what? Worthless pieces of metal!"</span>
>
> <span style="color:#1F687C">Hatsun: "Blasphemy! Metals are the gifts of the gods."</span>
> 
> <span style="color:#792909">Taryash: "Harumph!"</span>

Hakik informs the players that he was notified by the temple priests that after the eruption they discovered the sacred tablet was stolen.

Hakik is against foreigners coming into the village and is immediately suspicious that the adventurers have a direct involvement in the theft.

Each player will each be interrogated one at a time. While one player is in the interrogation room, the others are free to discuss amongst themselves. While they are waiting to be interrogated, they may encounter the priest named __Hiro__.

Good roleplaying will be critical for the players to be able to explain their whereabouts over the past day. More specifically provide a convincing explanation for why they are in the village. At the end of each interrogation have the player do a Charisma/Persuasion DC 15 with advantage if the role playing was convincing, with disadavantage if not convincing.

Give the players time to interact. Create some dynamic dialog with discussing some of the clues. After some time Hakik returns.

> <span style="color:#79093C">Hakik: "It is as I feared. The village is in flames and many of the villagers will lose their homes and rice fields. The courageous Scales of Ha are fighting now to use the waters of the falls to quell the village centre fire. However, I'm afraid the others most certainly will be lost."</span>
> 
> <span style="color:#1F687C">Hatsun: "But great dragon lord, certainly you do not expect these... villagers... to stay here?"</span>
> 
> <span style="color:#79093C">Hakik: "Where will you have them go!? Is it not just and good to provide shelter to those who need it as Ryū would will?"</span>
> 
> <span style="color:#1F687C">Hatsun, cowers and gets to his knees: "Uh uh, forgive me Head Dragon! The ashen air perhaps has clouded my mind!"</span>
>
> <span style="color:#79093C">Hakik: "Taryash, these... visitors... should go into the hall. I wish to speak to them alone."</span>
>
> <span style="color:#792909">Taryash: "Yes dragon lord. Yumakiro, do as commanded!"</span>
> 
> Yumakiro motions to the guards and clergy: "You, come with me!"

The players are brought into the hallway along with the guards, Hiro, Hatsun. However Taryash remains. Call the players in to the room one at a time. The walls are made of paper and are quite thin.

## Clues
There are a few clues that were found from the investigation.

- A hair tie from Nirimsea
- 3 different sets of footprints are found with dirt/mud on the lining (for a DC 20 perception flakes of gold in the print)
- Tiny parchments from the capsule are scattered about the room

Parchments:
- "I will repay my fathers debts and save our home."
- "I swear to keep my old neighbor company once a day."
- "I vow to destroy Ryū."
- "I promise to standup to the fish merchant always overcharging me and ask for 5 copper instead of giving into 6 copper!"
- "I will avenge my mother's killers!"

<div class='pageNumber'>3</div>
<div class='footnote'>DM'S GUIDE  | Part 1:  Crime &amp; Punishment</div>


\page

Hakik will ask each player the following interactions with Good Cop (Hakik) / Bad Cop (Taryash).

- "What has brought you to our wonderful village?"
- "Where have you been since coming to the village?"
- "Where were you before the eruption?"
- "Who can vouch for your story?"
- "Do you recognize this hair tie?"
- "Let's see how your foot compares to these footprints..."
- "Let me see your handwriting to compare with the note"

__DC 15 (Charisma/Persuasion) check. If Hakik is inclined to believe (good role play) then give the player advantage. If he is not inclined give the player disadvantage. If it was just okay then a regular roll.__

Take an average of all interrogation checks and use the formula below:

- "> 15" - great success, he believes your stories yet encourges you to join the Scales of Ha on a search to prove your loyalty: Option 1. If they refuse invite them as guests to the palace for the remainder of their stay: Option 2.
- "> 10" - success, he is unconvinced of the stories and is still moderately suspicious. Invites you to the palace to stay as "guests" for the remainder of the stay: Option 2.
- "< 10" - fail, he utterly does not believe your stories and is nearly convinced of your guilt. He sends you to the dungeon in the palace: Option 1.

After some time, while Hakik is just finishing the interrogations, his son __Fuling__ comes running into the room.

> <span style="color:#711E92">Fuling screams, “FATHER! They’ve taken my children!!!”</span>

If the majority of the players successfully passed the interrogation then the players are without any suspicion. Otherwise Hakik is suspicious of them.

Alternatively you can use a more generic success/fail system:

<div class='descriptive'>
##### Charisma/Persuasion DC 15:

<ul>
  <li style="color:#007E7E;font-weight:bold">SUCCESS - no accusations come from Hakik, however he is wary of having visitors when there are such major crimes happening. The players are asked to stay as guests in the palace (but are really prisoners). When the players tire of being under house arrest, they are allowed to leave to the village centre only if accompanied by the Scales of Ha.</li>
  <li style="color:#7E0000;font-weight:bold">FAIL -  the accusations begin to flood from Hakik as he is further enraged. Hiro suggests that the adventurers could not have been culpable of this, as they were sitting with him while waiting to be interrogated. Hakik, unconvinced of their innocence demands they prove their loyalty by joining the Scales of Ha in their search for the children.</li>
</ul>
</div>

```
```

## The Palace of the Head Dragon
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendnd/modules/master/doom-of-bahamut/assets/img/palace-of-head-dragon.png" style="width:100%;margin:20px" />

The adventurers may be taken to the palace for interrogation.

> ### Narration:
>
> The Palace of the Head Dragon is a large wooden palace with statues blocking the entrance to the staircase.

The players are either taken to the dungeon or to their rooms in the palace.

### Option 1: Dungeon
Virero will contact the players in prison to let them know he recognizes the gold on the dirt of the footprints. It could only come from the Angzh mountains and specifically a cavern with gold in it. He can help them break out of prison through the waterway and take them on a boat to the Angzh mountains trailhead.

<div class='pageNumber'>3</div>
<div class='footnote'>DM'S GUIDE  | Part 1:  Crime &amp; Punishment</div>


\page

### Option 2: Palace Guests
Hiro will visit the players and can take them around the village centre. There is a library with a rich history of Nirimsea the players can explore. There are many floors of the palace that are off limits. The players are free to explore most of the town centre. However, the players are always accompanied by guards and insist upon them not leaving the confines of the village. Hiro convinced of their innocence helps them escape at night in return for their help to solve the mystery and save the children.

### Options 3: Scales of Ha Conscripts
The players are forced to join the Scales of Ha on a wild goose chase through the Angzh mountains. While recruits they can interact with other soldiers and get to know the order. The Scales of Ha are so inexperienced they don't know what they are doing. Eventually the players should get frustrated and can seek help from either Hiro or Virero.

## Escape
The adventurers should be given an opportunity to escape on their own. If you look at the map of the palace you will see that the palace is situated over a river that leads to __Fuling Falls__. This river connects to the Angzh Mountains trailhead by boat. The center room directly over the river is the library. In the north-eastern most corner there is a statue. That statue covers an old wooden floor hatch that goes directly down to the edge of the river.

The adventurers may also attempt to open a window to throw a rope down to scale down from the window. However, the window will not open easily (Strength checks of DC 15) and will likely make a loud noise when trying to open them.

However the party is able to make it down to the river, they will eventually find a small boat along the river. However, the boat is going against the current so they will need to use their abilities wisely to make it up the river by boat. Alternatively, they may go by foot along the wooded path along the river to the trailhead.

You can use __Virero__ as a guide to navigate along the path and eventually lead into the caverns of the mountains. Alternatively there is an entrance into the caverns from the __Temple of Bahamut__ that can be led by __Hiro__. This entrance will be more tricky to get into as if the adventurers are in the palace they will have a long way to go undetected in the open to get to the temple.

# Part 2:  Search &amp; Rescue
The adventurers escape detainment either through alliance with their captors or through the aid of another ally (Hiro, Virero, etc.). If they choose to take the quest to rescue the dragonborn children then this next part will describe the steps taken to do that.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendnd/modules/master/doom-of-bahamut/assets/img/angzh-mountains.png" style="width:100%;margin:20px" />

The search will take place in the __mountains__ and the rescue will take place in the __caverns__.

> NOTE: Virero is an excellent guide of these mountains and should speed up the time it takes to navigate the caverns.

The adventurers will make their way through the mountains either coming from the __Temple of Bahamut__ or from the __Angzh Mountains Trailhead__ (by boat or by foot). 

The caverns are located significantly closer to the temple by way of the hot springs. Going from the trailhead will require more effort as the caverns are located further north up the trail. 

> NOTE: If the players allied with the Scales of Ha they will have their help in navigating the dangers of the mountains as well as in combat. 
>
> If the players did not ally with the Scales of Ha and have escaped then this becomes a peril for them as they will be navigating the mountains around the same time searching for the children.

```
```

## Random Encounters
The following random encounters are likely in the mountains:

##### Encounters Table
| D20 | Monster(s) | Total CR |
|:----:|:-------------|---------|
| 1-5  | 1 x Swarm of Spiders | 1/2 |
| 6-15  | 3 x Fox | 3/4 |
| 16-20 | 1 x Ice Toad  | 1 |

Eventually the players will need to get to the caverns, either through Hiro or Virero (or perhaps both). Once at the trailhead they must hike their way through the mountains and forests to get to the cavern. Or they can get to the caverns from a secret entrance from the temple.

Getting to the caverns, the players may discover a water spring in the cavern that produces long life to Dragonborn. There is plenty of gold and there are parts of the cavern that have lava flowing through it which illuminates the cavern.

The winding caverns are Angzh are full of gold and a small amount of platinum. The winding caverns are also the home of the worshipers of Akuma: Yukisu, Runhika and Misaru. The exit of the caverns goes the center of the Angzh mountains. The caverns are also home to many spawnlings that the worshipers have spawned.

There are also multicolored eggs that are glowing in the cavern, these are unhatched dragon spawns. They may encounter one that is about to hatch, and thus an encounter forms.

# Part 3: The Race for Time
The adventurers need to figure out that the villains are hiding in the caverns. The villains are waiting for a large formation in the night sky of a dragon's breath as a sign that Tiamat _Akuma_) is ready for an offering. They are looking to perform a spell on all 3 of the Head Dragon's children (descendants of Fuling) to create an enormous eruption that they believe will summon Akuma back from the Celestial plane.

The adventure ends with getting to the red-shaded corridor in the caverns. There is the symbol of Tiamat (Akuma) that must be drawn on the doors with black, blue, green, red, white ink. 

<div style="font-size:160px;margin:-10px 0 -130px 0;line-height:0">悪魔</div>

> __NOTE: This ink can be achieved by grabbing blood from the spawnlings either through combat or crushing an egg.__

Once inside the red-shaded corridor the adventurers will work their way down to where the ceremony is taking place.

There is not much time to find all 3 children tied up and rescue them before the ceremony begins. It will be extremely difficult to defeat all 3 of the villains during the ceremony so it is important if the adventurers are to be successful that they find the children quickly.
