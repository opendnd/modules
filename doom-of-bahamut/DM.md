# Introduction
The adventurers find themselves in the village of Fuling. A beautiful, serene village located high in the Angzh mountains. Before the first session, the adventurers should be able to answer the background questions from the Player’s Handout.

The ability to effectively answer these questions should influence how the characters are treated by certain NPC’s throughout the adventure.

## Overview
This micro-campaign is broken into three parts:

1. __Crime &amp; Punishment:__  the adventurers find themselves in a position where they are interrogated for the theft of the Platinum Ptarian Tablet from the Temple of Bahamut.

2. __Search &amp; Rescue:__  the adventurers discover that three innocent children have been abducted and should be presuaded to return them to safety. This poses a moral dilemma  if they refuse as the children will die from their capture.

3. __The Race for Time:__  eventually the adventurers learn that there is a time limit on the rescue of the children. The kidnappers plan to sacrifice the children for a ritual that must be performed on a specific day and time.

## Villains
The adventurers face three dragonwomen as their primary villains: __Yukisu__, __Runhika__ and __Misaru__. They are worshipers of the evil dragon goddess __Tiamat__ (_Akuma_) and are looking to seek favor with the goddess by joining the __Cult of the Dragon__.  Through their use of clerical rituals and their dragonspawn – the evil children of Tiamat – they form a team of powerful adversaries.

## Allies
The adventurers are able to gain allies throughout the adventure. Most notably, the dragonborn priest by the name of __Hiro__ (_Charisma DC 10_). The priest worships in the __Temple of Bahamut__ and is especially convinced of the adventurer’s innocence while being interrogated. There should be many opportunities for the adventurers to form this alliance. 

Other potential allies include __Virero__ (_Charisma DC 15_) and the __Scales of Ha__ (_Charisma DC 20_).

## Goal
The __primary goal__ for the adventurers will be to rescue the kidnapped children safely and prevent the rituals from being performed.

The __secondary goal__ is to return the stolen tablet safely to the temple. A stretch goal would be to capture the villains and bring them to justice.

```
```


## Adventure Hook
While visiting the village of Fuling, the players are __accused of stealing an item from the temple__. The interrogation is a distraction and gives the villains an opportunity to kidnap the dragonborn children.

As a result, the adventurers are forced to join the Scales of Ha to prove their loyalty to Bahamut. In doing so they should gain his favor and remove any doubt of their innocence.

## Climax
The adventurers should journey through the __Angzh Mountains__, through cavernous dungeons and eventually to the villain’s lair. There they should find the children trapped in a trio of rituals.

Ideally the adventurers should need to work together to save all three children at the same time. The potential should exist for one or more children to live yet the others perishing. This should put pressure on the outcome of the adventurers’ actions.

# Part 1:  Crime &amp; Punishment
The adventure begins in the Village of Fuling where the players have been visiting. The background questions from the Player's Handout should have been researched and ready to be answered before beginning the first session:

- You are a visitor in the village, what is your reasoning for visiting the village?
- What all have your done throughout your visit to the village?
- Did you meet any interesting characters throughout your visit?
- You’re nearing the end of your visit, where does your character intend to travel next?

> ### Narration:
> 
> You find yourselves in the tavern of the Fujiya Lodge. The ornate wooden multi-story lodge is located a few minutes walk from the village centre. The tavern has a large semi-circular wooden bar that appears to rise from the floor itself and several sets of tables made of large tree trunks. At the bar you see the enormous bartender serving an elderly dragonman.

While in the tavern, the characters should introduce themselves to each other. If necessary provoke them with a friendly dragonborn such as __Virero__ or __Komoi__ by asking who each character is and how their travels have been. 

The party may hear from a few of the NPC’s mentioning a gentle smoke and rumble over the past couple of days. The characters are encouraged to order food and drink while in the tavern, see the menu.

After a while of dialogue or if there’s a lull in the conversation have the party all roll a D20. 

__A volcano has erupted.__

  <li style="color:#7E0000;font-weight:bold">FAIL - the adventurer falls to the ground and will take damage (1D4).</li>
<ul>
</div>


Choose either Komoi or Virero to begin speaking to the adventurers:

> *with a heavy sigh*, “...It appears that Ryū’s Doom has returned to Fuling."
>
> *After a brief pause, he continues,*
>
> "This has happened before... I believe roughly 160 years ago. Then, it almost consumed the entire village in its wrath.”

```
```

> ### Food Menu: 
> _rice and mountain spring water are included with all meals_

Below are a few of the NPCs in the tavern:

------
> ### Virero
> Virero is an elderly dragonman with grey hair set upon his ruby red scales. His eyes resemble the withering embers of a once great roaring fire nearing its end. His personality is warm and comforting and many people treat him like the grandfather they’ve always known, while learning as much as possible from his love of telling Nirimsese Folktales.
>
> Virero lives on a farm about 20 minutes  from the lodge on the edge of the village centre. He enjoys coming to the tavern to speak to the tourist and share his stories.

-------
> ### Komoi
> Komoi is an enormous dragonman with green scales. He has a large square face  with bushy eyebrows. He is the owner of Fujiya Lodge.

## Detainment
The players may take their time to question the NPC’s about what is happening. After about 15-30 minutes of game time:

> ### Narration:
> 
> A stern-looking dragonman walks into the tavern accompanied by two guards. The dragonman’s many red-green scales coat his tall thin body and his face features a long pointy chin. The guards are wearing bold red robes with platinum belts. A symbol of two leaves balanced on a branch is clearly visible.

The dragonman is __Hakik, Head Dragon of Fuling__. The guards are known to be the __Scales of Ha__. A dialogue has occurred between Kakik and Komoi. After a minute or two the guards face to the adventurers, upon doing so the players will roll a D20.

<div class='descriptive'>
##### Charisma/Deception DC 20:

Success required by at least two players, the adventurers are now allied with the Scales of Ha for the duration of the adventure. If fail the guards will accuse the adventurers of committing the theft.

<ul>
  <li style="color:#007E7E;font-weight:bold">SUCCESS - the guards approach the adventurers to enlist their help. After some time for dialogue, skip to Part 2: Search &amp; Rescuse.;</li>
  <li style="color:#7E0000;font-weight:bold">FAIL - the guards shout, “STOP! YOU MUST COME WITH US!”</li>
<ul>
</div>

### Alternate
It's possible for the adventurers to leave the tavern before getting arrested. In this scenario the villagers will be making their way to the temple for shelter. By leaving shelter the adventurers are at risk for getting damage from the ash in the air (especially not being dragonborn).

<div class='descriptive'>
##### Constitution DC 15:

If the adventurer has not covered their mouth with any damp cloth then they are succeptible to lung damage.

<ul>
  <li style="color:#007E7E;font-weight:bold">SUCCESS - no effect</li>
  <li style="color:#7E0000;font-weight:bold">FAIL - roll 1D4 for damage</li>
<ul>
</div>

As the adventurers make their way through the crowd to the temple they will be spotted by the guards unless they are in stealth.

If they remain undetected there is an opportunity to befriend __Hiro__.

```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendnd/modules/master/doom-of-bahamut/assets/img/scales-of-ha.png" style="margin:20px" />

__The Scales of Ha__, or _Ha no Uroko (葉の鱗) in Nirimsese Draconic_, are a religious order and de facto police force for the Village of Fuling. Founded in 2985 N¥ by Hakik. They are relatively inexperienced as they are a new order and have had little to no challenges to season them.

Their symbol is composed of two leaves balanced upon a branch and wear bold red robes with a platinum belt. The Scales of Ha are led by Taryash, First Sensei of the order.

__Taryash__ is a medium-sized dragonman with green scales and ruby eyes. Often described as extremely clever and an extraordinary fighter. The long pointy ends of his mustache resemble the two swords he often uses in fighting.

The adventurers are being arrested, and will be interrogated by the Scales of Ha. They must account for their events over the past day. The interrogation takes place in the Palace of the Head Dragon (or alternatively can take place in the temple).
